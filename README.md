# hyprland-dots
These are my hyprland dots that I daily drive, I am not really in the business of making this into something others can use, but I might in the future.

## Plans:
- [ ] Implement wallust support
- [ ] Fastfetch config
- [ ] Clock that is displayed on the background layer
- [ ] List dependencies
